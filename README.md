# TITANIC
This is simple: using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.On April 15, 1912,
during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, 
there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
Now,
In this,i'm predicting whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.
